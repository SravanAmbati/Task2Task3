Task 2: 
Create a Python or JavaScript script that fetches data from an API endpoint and populates it into a CSV file. You can use any API endpoint of your choice, as long as it returns a JSON response. The CSV file should include the data from the JSON response and should be formatted correctly.
Instructions:
1.	Use Python or JavaScript to fetch data from an API endpoint. You can use any library or tool of your choice for this task.
2.	Process the JSON response and extract the necessary data that needs to be included in the CSV file.
3.	Use Python or JavaScript to write the data to a CSV file. You can use any library or tool of your choice for this task.
4.	Make sure that the CSV file is formatted correctly, with each row representing a record and each column representing a field from the JSON response.
5.	Document your code and include any necessary instructions for running the script.
Hint: Couple of API endpoints you can use:

Task 3: 
Create a Python or JavaScript script that reads data from a CSV file and updates it via a REST API endpoint. The script should use POST to add a new record if it doesn't exist, and PATCH to update a record if it already exists. You can use any REST API endpoint of your choice that supports these methods.
Instructions:
1.	Use Python or JavaScript to read data from a CSV file. You can use any library or tool of your choice for this task.
2.	Process the CSV file and extract the necessary data that needs to be updated via the REST API endpoint.
3.	Use Python or JavaScript to make REST API calls to add or update records. You can use any library or tool of your choice for this task.
4.	Make sure that the data is correctly formatted for the REST API endpoint.
5.	Document your code and include any necessary instructions for running the script.
